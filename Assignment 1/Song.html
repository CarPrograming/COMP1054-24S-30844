                If you can't see
            Beyond your nose
            And you don't hear a flower laugh

                If you can't speak
            Without having to hear your voice
            Using your heart

                Friend Sancho, listen to me
            Not everything here has a reason
            A path is made by the feet


                There's a world to discover
            And a life to snatch
            From the arms of the final script

                Sometimes, I feel when I wake up, oh
            That the dream is reality

                Drink, dance, dream
            Feel that the wind has been made for you
            Live, listen, and speak
            Using your heart for it
        
        
                Feel that the rain kisses your face
            When you make love
            Scream with your soul, scream so loud
            That, in your life, you are, my friend, the only actor

                If your opinion
            Fits in a yes or no
            And you don't know how to rectify

                If you can define
            Hatred or love
            Friend, what a disappointment!
        

                Not everything is black or white, it's gray
            Everything depends on the nuance
            Search and learn to distinguish

                The Moon can warm
            And the Sun can cradle your nights
            The trees die standing

                I've seen a spring cry, oh
            Seeing its waters go to the sea
        
        
                Drink, dance, dream
            Feel that the wind has been made for you
            Live, listen, and speak
            Using your heart for it

                Feel that the rain kisses your face
            When you make love
            Scream with your soul, scream so loud
            That, in your life, you are, my friend, the only actor

                Sometimes, I feel when I wake up, oh
            That the dream is reality


                Drink, dance, dream
            Feel that the wind has been made for you
            Live, listen, and speak
            Using your heart for it

                Feel that the rain kisses your face
            When you make love
            Scream with your soul, scream so loud

                Drink, dance, dream
            Feel that the wind has been made for you
            Live, listen, and speak
            Using your heart for it


                Feel that the rain kisses your face
            When you make love
            Scream with your soul, scream so loud
            That, in your life, you are, my friend, the only actor
